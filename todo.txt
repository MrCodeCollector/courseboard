email checkbox to send email to all particpants in a course
main navbar- catalog/my courses
my course section above course catalog
instructors are not "enrolled" in their own courses - when you create a course, enroll the instructor
  - change list to particpants in course page and automatically enroll instructor
  - course index page should show partial description, # of students signed up and objectives
add objectives/competencies to courses
add personal objectives to user
add course location/room
time and day of week for courses
create a "Product Team" that can be connected or independent from a course
Product Team has
  - user interviews
  - user narratives
  - user testing sessions
  - github link
  - live product link
  - evaluations
redesign course catalog page
BUG: when posting, it doesn't show up until refresh bc when we send back the ‘course’ object it doesn’t have the nested user subnode - add the currentUser as the ‘user’ subnode before pushing it into the array of ‘course.posts’ either on the server or the client
BUG: date picker icon is there when you are not the instructor - only instructor posts assignments
clarification of assignment vs announcement when actually posting

-----------------------------------------

list students alphabetically?? list my courses alphabetically??
date picker left side numbers - what are these? (week in the year - get rid of this)
add admin so they can set all classes and assign instructors (i.e. at beginning of term) and remove setting instructor for all other accounts when creating courses
manage my courses as instructor
tags/categories for courses
flashy enroll button! - unenroll is very unintuitive
archiving courses
comments on posts
see courses you are an instructor for in left col (profile)
repeat a course? multiple start times? change the start time?
Credits for attending courses
Search

-----------------------------------------

- email 3 days before course starts
- teach people how to make a course (kickstarter teaches you how to make a campaign)
course-index is only upcoming courses
